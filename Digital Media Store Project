# For this project, I used a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store. There are 11 tables in total including employees, customers, invoices, invoice_items, albums, artists, tracks, playlist_track, playlists, media_types, and genres.
# Below are some SQL questions I answered using the dataset.

# Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country
FROM chinook.customers

# Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

# Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.Invoiceid, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust

# Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

# Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

# Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
